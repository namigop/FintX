# Contributing to FintX

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to help improve the software.

## Important Notice

This project is dual-licensed under both:
- **GPLv3** for the open source version
- **Commercial license** for proprietary/commercial use

The commercial offering is essential for the long-term sustainability of this project. It will provide the necessary funding to ensure continued development, maintenance, and support â€” helping us avoid the fate of many open source projects that become unmaintained due to lack of sustainable funding.
However, due to the copyleft nature of the GPLv3 license, accepting contributions from external developers could create complications with our commercial licensing model. So in order to avoid potential issues, we are unable to accept code contributions

While we cannot accept direct code contributions, there are other valuable ways you can support the project:

### Bug Reports (We love these!)
- Report bugs and issues through GitHub Issues

- Include system information and error logs
- Test and verify bug fixes

### ðŸ’¡ Feature Requests

### Community Support

### Collaboration Opportunities
